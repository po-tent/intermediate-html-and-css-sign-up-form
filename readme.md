vanilla HTML // vanilla CSS // vanilla JS

In my front-end education, I came across a project where I was asked to build a page with the layout acheived (not mobile friendly). 

The BIGGER 'challenge' was to make the form validatable.

Instead of your typical dummy content, I went ahead and made it lit (cool).

DISCLAIMER: I am in no way affiliated with Rick and/or Morty. I just love the show :P
